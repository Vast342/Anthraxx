### Anthraxx

A work-in-progress UAI Ataxx engine, using skills obtained from working on my chess engine, Clarity.

The goal for this project is to take all of the things that I learned from Clarity, make this engine the best that it can be, and learn the things that I avoided learning for Clarity.

Special Thanks to Ciekce for the name
